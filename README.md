# Odin Book Backend server

This is an express backend server for the [Odin-Book Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-nodejs-odin-book) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). It uses the following technologies:

- Typescript

## Server Error Response

Before we go in detail into the endpoints, it's important to mention that all these endpoints can either return a custom successful JSON response, or a standardized error. The client will be able to get these error responses from the server and interpret them to make decisions on the frontend.

```JSON
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "some message",
    "details": {
      "property": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

Validation errors can look a bit different, like so

```JSON
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "you have one or more validation errors"
  },
  "validationErrors": {
    "email": {
      "type": "field",
      "value": "curios123",
      "msg": "Invalid value",
      "path": "email",
      "location": "body"
    },
    "password": {
      "type": "field",
      "value": "",
      "msg": "Invalid value",
      "path": "password",
      "location": "body"
    }
  }
}
```

### `POST /auth/signin`

  "refreshToken": "<refresh token>"
}
```

The delete confirmation phrase is hardcoded as "delete my account", i wanted to use password confirmation but since some user accounts are from Google, i choose to make the confirmation phrase the same for all users. The front end should use an ajax request with a user submitted confirmation phrase. This is just an added step to ensure they really want to delete their account.
